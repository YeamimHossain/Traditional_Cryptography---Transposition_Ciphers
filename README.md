# Traditional Cryptography — Transposition Ciphers

Welcome to the **Transposition Ciphers** repository! This project implements classical **transposition cipher techniques**, a foundational category of traditional cryptography where the positions of characters in the plaintext are rearranged to generate ciphertext while keeping the characters unchanged.

Transposition ciphers are historically significant and provide essential insight into early encryption mechanisms that preceded modern cryptographic systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains implementations of several **transposition cipher methods**, including both keyless and key-based approaches. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the working principles of classical cryptographic algorithms in a clear and educational manner.

Implemented ciphers include:

- **Keyless Transposition Cipher**
- **Keyed Transposition Cipher**
- **Columnar Transposition Cipher**

Each cipher is implemented using **Python** and provided in **Jupyter Notebook** format for better readability, experimentation, and learning.
